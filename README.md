# WeCall

This is a mobile web app built with Cordova, Ionic, Angular, Node.js and Google Cloud Messaging Service.

It allows users to classify their phone contacts based on degree of closeness instead of their relationship.
Then the app will push one notification to the user everyday to remind him/her to call one contact and send greetings.
The contact will be selected randomly with a weight of his/her group.
